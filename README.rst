MyDS: my data science codes and notebooks
============================================

Overview
========
Welcome to MyDS. This is the repository to hold my data science codes and notebooks. This repository should include

- **algo**: implementation of basic algorithms in Machine Learning
- **module**: general python modules for data manipulation, modelling, feature engineering, visualization, etc.
- **test**: unit tests.
- **project**: individual data science projects using modules
- **utility**: things that are hard to implement in a generic way, but could be useful in some cases.



Documentation
===============
If you have Sphinx installed, you can build the documentation using

    ``cd docs; make html``

for local browsing.


I will gradually move my past projects to this repository, Please stay tuned
