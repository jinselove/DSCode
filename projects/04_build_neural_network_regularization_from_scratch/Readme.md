=======
This project is inspired by Class 1 assignment in course "Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization" by Andrew Ng
on Coursera. In this project, different regularization methods, including no-regularization, L2-regularization and Dropout, and their backpropagation are
implemented from Scratch.
