=======
This project is inspired by Class 2 assignment in course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Andrew Ng
on Coursera. In this project, a logistic regression classifier is built from scratch to detect cats.

### 1. data
One can download the data/ folder from [This link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aa1lb2mlxc9cvlm/AAAvsq96yy1uzaq73GYX-oT4a?dl=0) and put it under this directory. 

### 2. src/
This folder contains the notebook and python source code for Logistic regression. 

#### 2.1 main.py
> Python code. Requires the existence of "data/" folder in the upper directory

#### 2.2 Logistic+Regression+with+a+Neural+Network+mindset+v5.ipynb
> Python Notebook. To actually run this notebook, we need to download more data, which can be found at
https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/notebook/zAgPl/logistic-regression-with-a-neural-network-mindset
