### 1. data/
This folder contains the datasets used by source code. 

### 2. src/
This folder contains the notebook and python source code for Logistic regression. 

#### 2.1 main.py
Python code. Requires the existence of "data/" folder in the upper directory

#### 2.2 Logistic+Regression+with+a+Neural+Network+mindset+v5.ipynb
Python Notebook. To actually run this notebook, we need to download more data, which can be found at
