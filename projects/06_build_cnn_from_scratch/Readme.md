=======
This project is inspired by [Class 1 assignment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/notebook/7XDi8/convolutional-model-step-by-step) in course "Convolutional Neural Networks" by Andrew Ng on Coursera. 
In this project, a Convolutional Neural network is built from scratch.
