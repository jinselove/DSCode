   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to MyDS!
================================
First of all, MyDS is not a software. Instead, it is like a hub of my general practices related to Machine learning
algorithms(:ref:`algo`), Data Science Projects(:ref:`project`), Handy utilities/scripts(:ref:`utility), Learning notes
(:ref:`note`),etc. The purpose of building MyDS is to force myself write and document codes in a more professional way.
However, due to lack of time cleaning and documenting codes, only selected work of potential use will be hosted in MyDS.
